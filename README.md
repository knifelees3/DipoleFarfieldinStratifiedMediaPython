# Dipole Farfield in Stratified Media
Python Version of Dipole Emission in Stratifield Media

There are some notebooks that show the use of this program.


* `RunAllFunctions.ipynb` shows the general use of this program including the fitting process
* `Verify_ChenNatPhoton.ipynb` this is a benchmark of this program by comparing with the reference.
* `Verify_DipoleEmissiononSub.ipynb` shows the dipole emission in two media interface and benchmark with the MATLAB version
* `Verify_DipoleEmissiononThin-Sub.ipynb` another examples of three media interface
* `AccuracyTestofLeastSquareFitting.ipynb` the programs that try to fit the patterns

## To be done
- [ ] Check the exact expression of the farfield electric field and patterns
